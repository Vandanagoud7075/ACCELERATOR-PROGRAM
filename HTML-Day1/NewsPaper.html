<h1>City Embraces Greener Future with New Park Plan</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Community-led initiative aims to plant 10,000 trees over five years</h2>



<p>
The city council announced an ambitious program on Monday that will transform vacant lots into pocket parks, community gardens, and tree-lined boulevards. Residents and local organizations have been invited to participate in planning sessions starting next month, offering ideas on how to make public spaces greener and more accessible for everyone.

City officials say the initiative is designed not only to improve the look and feel of neighbourhoods but also to address climate concerns, reduce urban heat islands, and create new habitats for pollinators. Funding for the first phase will come from a mix of municipal bonds and private grants, with volunteer groups expected to contribute to planting and maintenance efforts.
